* About

  This is my attempt to reduce clutter when viewing files written in org-mode. I
  think it looks very noisy to look at all the markup, especially in readme
  files when they are display in Dired buffers with my [[https://github.com/amno1/dired-auto-readme][dired-auto-readme]]
  mode. When viewing other peoples org-files, I am usually mostly interested in
  the content, not so in markup. Org-view-mode is an attempt to create a
  read-only "viewer" mode so I can move in buffer in style of Dired buffers,
  without using modifier kyes and not need to worry about accidentally writing
  to it either.
  
* Screencast

  [[./screencast.gif]]
  
* Installation  

  Either clone this repo or just download 'org-view-mode.el'.

  Put org-view-mode.el somewhere in Emacs load-path. From there you
  can either:

  M-x package-install-file RET org-view-mode.el RET

  or just require file in your init file somewhere.

* Requirements

  Really none, should be compatible with Emacs 22.1 but package.el does not
  recognize requirements older than Emacs 24.1.

  I am not sure at which versions some of org features are introduced, so there
  might be a bit of requirement, but in general, I really use nothing but Emacs
  regex search facility and text properties, so this should really be compatible
  even with files that does not use features addressed in this mode; regex search
  will just not match and no action will be taken.

* Usage

  M-x org-view-mode to turn it on/off.

  If you use export options for title and author, and have placed them
  strategically in the file (on top), you can set 'org-view-center-credentials'
  to 't if you wish to center the title and author, to resemble sort of a
  title. It is a buffer-local variable.

  If you find an author and title elsewhere in a file, it might look
  disturbing with centered line of text in the middle of a file, so you can turn
  off centering with:

  M-x org-view-pretty-credentials-mode

  It is possible to separately turn on/off leading stars in both viewer and
  normal org-mode with:

  M-x org-view-hide-stars-mode

  as well as tags and properties with org-view-hide-tags-mode and
  org-view-hide-properties-mode.

  Since toggle commands are implemented as minor modes, there is also an option
  to diminsh those small modes when org-view-mode is started:

  (setq org-view-diminish-mode t)

  This will not diminish org-view-mode itself, just those four small minor
  toggle modes. To expurge org-view-mode from the modeline too, use something
  like [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/diminish][diminish]] or [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/delight.html][delight]], or whatever you already use.
  
* Issues

  This far, this is just a prototype. This lacks one or another user command, to
  put it mildly. I do enable view-mode, so there are already quite few commands
  that work, amongst them space for scrolling, < and > to go to the end and
  beginning etc. See info node on view-mode in Emacs manual.

  The idea was also to enable just parts of markup to be turned on/off. Thus
  there are several minor modes. Each minor mode acts like a toggle to hide/show
  a part of org-mode markup. I had ambition to create a toggle per each export
  feature as well, for example texinfor only, html only, etc, but shear amount
  of keywords and options is just too much for this to be practical. Currently
  it is possible to separately control leading stars and tags in headings, and
  property and property drawers. I am also not sure if I will leave this
  separate features either, or I will just toggle on/off all at once. Those small
  separate modes can also be used in normal org-mode, without veiewer mode on,
  for example to just hide leading stars.

  I would like to hear input, ideas, suggestions and problems found. I don't
  promise to implement everything or any at all, but if something can be
  implemented relatively easy and is useful I would like to hear the idea.
  Let me know.

* Special thanks

  I am not very good user of org-mode myself, so I don't have any org-mode files
  with complex markup of my own, so I have used some from others for both tests
  and the screencast above. I will like to thank to authours for putting up their
  code and Readme files and for leting us use them freely, in order of appereance
  in the screencast above, to [[https://github.com/oantolin][Omar Antol√≠n Camarena]] for [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]], [[https://github.com/takaxp][Takaaki
  Ishikawa]] for [[https://github.com/takaxp/moom][moom]], [[https://github.com/protesilaos/mct][Protesilaos Stavrou]] for [[https://github.com/protesilaos/mct][mct]] and [[https://github.com/okamsn][Okamsn]] for [[https://github.com/okamsn/loopy][loopy]]. Thank you.
